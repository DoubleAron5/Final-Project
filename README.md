#### Description:

There were many thoughts that went through my head when first making a plan for what to make on this project. It was pretty hard just choosing a topic, but I also had no clue where to code and how to use anything. One of my friends suggested Studio Code, which I used, and it helped a lot. I was contemplating on whether or not to use c++ instead of python, but python was the better choice here._

So, I had the language of code chosen and the place on where to code. Now all I needed was what to make. I had a few ideas like:
- a website that could tell you attractions nearby
    - I had this idea because whenever I go somewhere on a trip, it can become quite difficult to get honest reviews on a place
 
- an app that allows you to keep track of your contacts (with permission of course)
    - I chose this idea because there are times when I wonder where my mom goes and when she'll come back
    
- a calculator
    - This was a pretty easy thing to make and it could be better than using the website calculators because of their advertisements and everything else in the background

In the end, I had to choose the calculator because the website idea was already being used for another project of mine and the tracking app would take too long to make. I had problems on where to start, but eventually started with the buttons and where they would go and then working on their functions.

It seemed pretty easy, I chose the blue and white color-scheme because of how simple and easy it is. Also I decided the pattern of the button by trying to mimic one of the calculators online. In the end, coding the calculator wasn't that hard and the project looked exactly how I imagined it.
